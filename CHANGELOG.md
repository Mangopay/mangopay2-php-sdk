### New events for PreAuthorization

Some of you use a lot the [PreAuthorization](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/preauthorizations#e183_the-preauthorization-object) feature of our API. To make your life easier, we have added three new events :

- PREAUTHORIZATION_CREATED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_SUCCEEDED
- PREAUTHORIZATION_FAILED

The goal is to help you monitor a PreAuthorization with a [webhook](https://docs.mangopay.com/endpoints/v2.01/hooks#e246_the-hook-object).

*Example: If a PreAuthorization is desynchronized, when the status is updated, you will be able to know it.*

### PSR4 / PSR12 compliance

- Thanks to @MockingMagician, the SDK is PSR4 / PSR12 compliant. That help your IDE and make sure you can run tests on case-sensitive system. Plus, docker environments has been added to run tests locally in all PHP major versions.

## Changed
- To better illustrate the fact that Rate Limiting Reset is a timestamp, we have change $rateLimits[0]->ResetTimeMillis to $rateLimits[0]->ResetTimeTimestamp

## [3.3.0] - 2021-03-25
## Added

### On demand feature for 3DSv2

> **This on-demand feature is for testing purposes only and will not be available in production**

#### Request

We've added a new parameter `Requested3DSVersion` (not mandatory) that allows you to choose between versions of 3DS protocols (managed by the parameter `SecureMode`). Two values are available:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`

If nothing is sent, the flow will be 3DS V1.

The `Requested3DSVersion` may be included on all calls to the following endpoints:
* `/preauthorizations/card/direct`
* `/payins/card/direct`

#### Response

In the API response, the `Requested3DSVersion` will show the value you requested:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`
* `null` – indicates that nothing was requested

The parameter `Applied3DSVersion` shows you the version of the 3DS protocol used. Two values are possible:
* `V1`
* `V2_1`

## Fixed

* Fixed UBO declaration by adding missing `UserId`
* Added missing `Billing` in `/payins/card/web`
* Test on `IpAddress` presence in `/payins/card/direct`
